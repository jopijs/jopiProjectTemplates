# About

Each folder in the `@routes` directory match an url segment.  
Example: the folder '@routes/my/url/route' match `http://localhost:3000/my/url/route`.

Here whe have four subfolder:

```
|- @routes/
   |- aboutRoutes/
      |- myAPI              < Listen "http://localhost:3000/aboutRoutes/myAPI"
      |- product            < Listen "http://localhost:3000/aboutRoutes/product"    
      |- reactPage          < Listen "http://localhost:3000/aboutRoutes/reactPage"
      |- catchAll           < Listen "http://localhost:3000/aboutRoutes/catchAll"
```

You only have to create a directory to listen to his corresponding url.
